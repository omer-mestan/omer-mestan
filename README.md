## 👋 Hello, I’m Yumer Mestan

🎓 I’m an IT student at the Technical University of Sofia, studying Information Technologies in Industry. I’m passionate about software development, software testing and creating real-world solutions using clean and well-structured code.

💡 I’ve earned certifications in Front-End, Back-End, Computer Science and Python from Codecademy, Google and LinkedIn. I’m currently learning Django, REST APIs, databases, and preparing for the ISTQB certification.

💻 I’m actively looking for an internship or junior position where I can apply my skills, learn from experienced developers, and grow in a professional environment. I enjoy teamwork, responsibility and real challenges.

🌍 I am deaf, but I communicate fluently using mobile transcription apps, Bulgarian Sign Language and verbal speech. I’m also studying English at the British Council to improve my international communication and career opportunities.

📈 My GitHub includes real academic projects such as:
- ✈️ AirportFlightManager – REST API system for managing flight operations
- 🛠️ Practical software testing with custom permissions and filters

🎨 Outside of tech, I love anime (especially Naruto), drawing, cooking, and learning languages. I speak Bulgarian, Turkish, English and Bulgarian Sign Language.
